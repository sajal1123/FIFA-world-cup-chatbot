Hmm, it seems like you're not too excited. Maybe talking about it will get you in the spirit!
Tell me Nihal Chandra, which team are you supporting in this year's world cup?
I'll be supporting Argentina
Ah, the most in-form team in the world! They are strong favourites to win for sure. Coming into the World Cup off the back of a 36-match unbeaten streak isn't too shabby. They will be looking to add to their recent Copa America victory.
Who is your favorite player?
Messi
Greatest footballer of all time! He will be looking to complete his trophy cabinet by adding the missing piece- the World Cup.

They have a strong chance, but I have an instinct that some other team might play a spoilsport
