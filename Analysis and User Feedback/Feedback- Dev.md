Welcome to the FIFA WORLD CUP 2022 chatbot!

What is your name?
Hi, My name is Dev Milan Mehta
Thanks Dev Milan Mehta!
Are you excited for the upcoming FIFA World Cup?
Not really, I do not watch soccer a lot, I only watch the finals and semi finals.

Hmm, it seems like you're not too excited. Maybe talking about it will get you in the spirit!
Tell me Dev Milan Mehta, which team are you supporting in this year's world cup?
I am supporting Argentina because my favorite soccer player, Leo Messi plays for that team.
Ah, the most in-form team in the world! They are strong favourites to win for sure. Coming into the World Cup off the back of a 36-match unbeaten streak isn't too shabby. They will be looking to add to their recent Copa America victory.
Who is your favorite player?
Leo Messi
Greatest footballer of all time! He will be looking to complete his trophy cabinet by adding the missing piece- the World Cup.
How confident are you about your team's chances?
I am not so sure about them winning. I do not follow soccer much so I am not sure how good/bad are the other teams, but I know that for the past few worldcups, they have been losing.
